## HTML/CSS
<p>The first introduction did a good job at explaining the set up for the book. Explaining how it was layered and such, while also going into a little detail about CSS/HTML as a whole. 
</p>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>This chapter was good at explaining key components like "what is an atribute" or "what is an element" and stuff. It also explained the layout of a HTML website more. </p>
<h2> Chapter 8</h2>
    <p>This chapter went more into what each element and character means and how to really use them while in HTML. Going over everything from ID's to Class. </p>
<h2> Chapter 17</h2>
    <p>This chapter started getting into more CSS. Teaching how to organize a website through styling in HTML5.</p>
<h2> Chapter 18</h2>
    <p>This chapter was moreso explaining to look at things not from your perspective, but another. You want to consider how the website will look from another's view. How it will function. Why it will work, etc. </p>

### JavaScript & JQuery
<h2> Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>This first chapter went over kinda getting you in the mindset of a developer. It wants you to understand to plot out your ideas/tickets/goals first, before even touching code. Have everything plotting and planned. </p>
